Here’s a side-by-side list you can keep, with the raw trauma language on the left and the reframed healing language on the right.

### **Trauma self-talk vs. Healing reframe**

* **“I’m broken.”**
  → “I adapted to survive. What feels broken are survival strategies that once protected me.”

* **“Something’s missing in me.”**
  → “What’s missing is what I was denied. I am whole—the absence is in what I received, not in who I am.”

* **“It was stolen from me.”**
  → “Safety and trust were taken, not my worth. What was stolen doesn’t define what remains.”

* **“I’m damaged goods.”**
  → “The damage belongs to the trauma, not to me. I carry scars, not contamination.”

* **“I don’t work like other people.”**
  → “My system is wired for survival. It can be rewired for living. Different doesn’t mean defective.”

* **“I feel empty inside.”**
  → “That emptiness is the echo of unmet needs. It points to what I deserved and can still cultivate.”

* **“I’ll never be normal.”**
  → “My normal was shaped by trauma. I can build a new normal, on my own terms.”
